As I majored in history, it's probably no surprise that I am a major history nerd: particularly in U.S. and Texas history.

If there is a history museum anywhere in my vicinity, I try to make time to visit it. I am a huge fan of the National Park System and one day hope to visit every significant NPS site and complete my National Parks passport. So far, I have visited 7 of the 14 sites in Texas (and an assortment of sites outside of Texas), which might not seem like much of an accomplishment until you remember how huge Texas is!

Unfortunately, I underutilized my time at Amherst in regards to visiting historical sites. I essentially lost two years of opportunities due to COVID, and you really needed a car to get around in Western Massachusetts (which, as a Texan, I did not have). I still managed to hit a few highlights such as the Springfield Armory, Old Slater Mill, Saint-Gaudens NHP, Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller NHP, Independence Hall, The Met, and The American Museum of Natural History. However, considering Boston alone has dozens of historical sites and I somehow never managed to visit, I still have a lot to see.

My next targets to visit in Texas are the historic French Legation in Austin (as I saw the French half in Paris) and the Blackwell School NHS in Marfa when it fully opens.

I'll get around to filling this page with pictures at some point in the future.
