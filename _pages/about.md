Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a MS student in data science at the University of Texas at Austin, expecting to graduate in Spring 2025.

My journey into data science began at Amherst College, where I graduated in 2023 with a wild combination of majors: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, and History. Why four majors? Each field offers its own rigorous analytical frameworks and problem-solving methodologies which all end up interconnected in some way. Blending these fields has led me into data science, where I can leverage their combined strengths.

Here, you'll find insights into my projects, experiences, and ongoing adventures. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site!

This site is very much under construction. Please bear with me as I work to make it perfect!
